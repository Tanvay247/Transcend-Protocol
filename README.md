# 🌍 Transcend Protocol

### "Tell us WHAT you want to happen. We handle HOW it happens."

Transcend is a system built to make digital actions (like moving or swapping money across blockchains) safe, automatic, and simple. 

Today, doing anything on a blockchain is too hard. You have to pick the right app, the right chain, and hope nothing fails halfway. Transcend changes this by using **Intent-Based Execution.**

## 🧩 The Core Idea
1. **User Intent:** You sign a simple message saying: "I want to swap 100 USDC on Ethereum for at least 0.04 ETH on Base."
2. **Solver Competition:** Professional "Solvers" look at your request and compete to do the work for you.
3. **Safe Settlement:** The Transcend system only pays the Solver **after** it proves the ETH arrived in your wallet. If it doesn't arrive, you keep your money.

## 📁 Repository Structure
